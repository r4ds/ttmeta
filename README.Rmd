Find TidyTuesday datasets by variable name, variable class, and likely other things.
Right now I'm focused on getting and cleaning the data.
The package will include a frozen version of the data, plus functions to fetch updated data.
The package will be much more useful after I've added functions to help search through the data (which will, as the package name implies, eventually be used to power an API and Shiny app).

## Installation

You can install the development version of ttmeta from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
